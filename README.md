# divcrawler
A web crawler for scraping and analyzing diversity report content using joephofhuis/DivPAR. I created this to assist a graduate student with their research.
- The code was written quick and dirty due to very tight client budget limitations. 
- Using a class based structure, function calls in lieu of the nested crawl loop, and a CLI interface are some primary improvements I would've liked to make for this project.
